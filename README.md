I think solving Codeforce questions can be a good way to practice algorithm and data structure. I will try to post the codes here as I solve new questions. (All answers are accepted)

I hope it will be useful for you and don't forget that the goal is to learn and know more about our programming languages :)

## :mag: Find questions on the Codeforces site
By writing the file name instead of [NUMBER] and [LETTER] in the following link, you will have access to questions:

https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/ [NUMBER] / [LETTER]

for example:
<br>
[https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/A)
<br>
(This was the first question that I solved with great enthusiasm using the C++ language üòç)
